# Privacy policy

The privacy policy for the server is simple.

#### 1 -- Nothing is saved

Uploaded `.txt` logs and generated `.pdf` files are immediately removed upon returning them to you.

#### 2 -- Only filename and timestamp are logged

Here is what the log looks like.

```js
>>> File received: one.txt | at: 2018/2/24 23:38:11
>>> File received: two.txt | at: 2018/2/24 23:38:15
>>> File received: three.txt | at: 2018/2/24 23:38:18
